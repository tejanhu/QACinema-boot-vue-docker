= Spring Boot + Vue.js + Docker Template

Contains a template project with the following contents

* Spring Boot Application with a single HTTP service
* Enunciate for API documentation generation
* Vue.js application with a sample component
* Axios as http client in the UI application
* Webpack Build for the frontend including live reload
* Maven Build for the backend which also wraps the frontend build
* A Dockerfile to create an image from the jar produced.
* Travis build instructions running the maven and Docker build


== Building

. Run `npm install` in `src/main/frontend`
. Run `mvn clean install` from the project's root to build the complete application.
. Run `docker build -t tejanhu/qacinema .` or use your own tag

You now have a docker image containg your backend and your frontend.
The generated API documentation is located at `/doc/index.html`

The docker image is pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/wernerw/boot-vue-docker/

== Running

* To run the jar directly, use `java -jar target/qacinema*.jar`
* To run inside a container on port 8080, use `docker run -p8080:8080 tejanhu/qacinema`

== Development

Run `npm run dev` from `src/main/frontend` to run the a local dev server for UI development. The dev server will run on http://localhost:8081. It proxies the requests to backend HTTP API expected to run on http://localhost:8800/api. So you can run the backend from your IDE and the frontend in the dev server.

If you run the complete package, the frontend requests will be made against `/api` on the same server.

FUTURE
== Roadmap

* [frontend] Add karma unit tests
* [frontend] Add vue components (vuestrap or vue-material)
* [backend] Add integration tests for the API w/ RESTAssured
* [backend] Add coverage with jacoco
* [backend] Implement ports and adapter/ring architecture with example domain, repository, http and JPA adapters 
* [build] Replace enunciate with swagger?
